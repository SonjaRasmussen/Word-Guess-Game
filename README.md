# Word-Guess-Game
Third class assignment Java Script


This is a simple game of hangman.  The computer selects a random name of a famous female from a pre-selected list.  The user has 20 guesses to get the correct answer.  If the user guesses the correct female before they are out of guesses then the user wins and their score will increase by 1. User presses the "New Game" botton to start again.  Sounds have been added for correct answers, duplicate guesses and background music.
